MediGuardians – Ensuring Quality and Safety in the Medical Supply Chain

Finalist Project – Smart India Hackathon 2024 (Hardware Edition)  
Tech Stack: Hyperledger Fabric, Java Chaincode, IoT Sensors, FlutterFlow UI

Overview

MediGuardians is an advanced IoT + Blockchain solution designed to ensure the quality, traceability, and compliance of medical supplies across the healthcare supply chain. It addresses challenges in storage, transport, and verification of sensitive medicines and consumables.

Key Features

- IoT Monitoring: Real-time temperature and humidity tracking during storage and transport  
- Blockchain Traceability: Secure ledger of every transaction using Hyperledger Fabric  
- Automated Quality Rejection: Smart contracts auto-reject substandard items based on thresholds  
- FIFO Inventory System: Ensures supplies are used in order, minimizing expiry and waste

Benefits

- Enhanced Patient Safety: Assures medical supplies are within safe conditions  
- Full Transparency: End-to-end visibility of supply chain events  
- Fraud Prevention: Immutable blockchain logs help prevent tampering  
- Reduced Human Error: Automated quality control through smart contracts

My Contribution

- Built Java-based Chaincode modules for asset transfer, inventory management, and rejection handling  
- Deployed and tested contracts using Hyperledger Fabric on local test network  
- Contributed to FlutterFlow UI for hospital, supplier, and manufacturer dashboards  
- Integrated IoT input logic for real-time quality validation (temperature and humidity)
